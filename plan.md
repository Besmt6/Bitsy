# plan.md — Bitsy: Payment Flexibility + Guest Dashboard + Crypto Marketplace + Billing Enforcement (UPDATED)

## 1) Objectives
- ✅ Ship a **crypto-first** booking system where **crypto is the default** payment method.
- ✅ Add optional **pay-at-property** payment method (hotel-controlled) with **guest-initiated confirmation** (guest must call hotel) to prevent spam.
- ✅ Implement a full **booking status lifecycle** including confirmation deadlines and transfer/marketplace states.
- ✅ Ship a **Guest Dashboard** (email + phone lookup) to view/cancel/manage bookings without requiring an account.
- ✅ Ship a **secondary marketplace** (**crypto bookings only**, **zero commission**) to list/transfer bookings with on-chain-verifiable payment proof.
- ✅ Implement **auto-cancel** for unconfirmed pay-at-property bookings at **exactly 48 hours before check-in**, plus marketplace listing expiry cleanup.
- ✅ Self-host the **demo video** (remove HeyGen dependency / monthly fee).
- ✅ Security/UX hardening: **remove external wallet download links** (avoid phishing/spam links); direct users to official app stores and in-app wallet connection.
- ✅ **Monetization**: Implement **“Pay What You Save” billing enforcement** (free $5,000, then commission) with trial tracking, grace period, and booking blocking after grace.
- ✅ **Spam prevention**: Add **hotel location verification** (address submission + status tracking) to reduce fake/spam hotel listings.

## 2) Implementation Steps

### Phase 1 — Core POC (Isolation): Transfer + Verification + 48h Cancellation ✅ COMPLETED
> Core risk = multi-step state machine + on-chain verification + scheduled auto-cancel.

**User stories (POC)**
1. ✅ As a guest, I can list a *crypto-paid* booking for transfer and it becomes locked.
2. ✅ As a buyer, I can submit a payment tx hash and Bitsy verifies it on-chain.
3. ✅ As the system, I can transfer booking ownership to the buyer after verification.
4. ✅ As a guest, I can see a clear “non-refundable crypto” warning and transfer alternative.
5. ✅ As the system, I auto-cancel pay-at-property bookings exactly 48h before check-in if still unconfirmed.

**Delivered (POC)**
- ✅ Updated `BookingStat` model fields for status + payment method + transfer lifecycle.
- ✅ Added `MarketplaceListing` model.
- ✅ Built marketplace endpoints:
  - `POST /api/marketplace/list`
  - `POST /api/marketplace/submit-proof`
  - `GET /api/marketplace/listings`
  - `GET /api/marketplace/listings/:listingId`
  - `POST /api/marketplace/unlist`
- ✅ Created auto-cancel job script: `backend/scripts/auto-cancel-bookings.js`.
- ✅ Added cron service (hourly auto-cancel + daily marketplace cleanup).

**Exit criteria (POC) — Met**
- ✅ Listing lock prevents cancellation/double-listing.
- ✅ Proof verification rejects invalid tx and accepts valid tx.
- ✅ Ownership transfer updates booking guest ownership.
- ✅ Auto-cancel transitions status correctly at 48h cutoff.

### Phase 6 — Billing Enforcement System (“Pay What You Save”) + Anti-Spam Hotel Verification ✅ COMPLETED

#### 6.1 Billing model decisions (confirmed)
- **Trial allowance**: $5,000 gross booking volume.
- **What counts**:
  - ✅ Crypto bookings count (auto-confirmed).
  - ✅ Pay-at-property bookings count **only when confirmed by hotel**.
- **Post-trial commission**: Hotels that accept crypto will be asked to pay Bitsy in **crypto**.
- **Grace period**: 7 days after crossing $5,000.
- **Enforcement**: Do not block immediately at $5,000; block only after grace period ends.
- **Starter tier limit**: **One hotel per email** (already enforced by unique email constraint).

#### 6.2 Data model changes ✅ Delivered
- **Hotel**
  - Added `tier: starter | growth | enterprise` (default `starter`).
  - Added `billing`:
    - `trialLimitUsd` (default `5000`)
    - `trialUsedUsd` (cached)
    - `trialExceededAt`
    - `graceEndsAt`
    - `billingStatus: trial | grace | blocked | active`
    - `commissionRateBps` (default `200` = 2%)
    - `lastPaymentReceivedAt`
  - Added `locationVerification`:
    - address fields + `verificationStatus` + `isVerified` + timestamps.

#### 6.3 Billing calculation + state machine ✅ Delivered
- Implemented `backend/src/services/billingService.js`:
  - Aggregates confirmed bookings to compute `trialUsedUsd`.
  - State machine:
    - `trial` → `grace` at $5k crossing (sets `trialExceededAt` + `graceEndsAt = +7d`)
    - `grace` → `blocked` after `graceEndsAt`
    - `blocked/grace` → `active` when payment is submitted

#### 6.4 Server-side enforcement points ✅ Delivered
- **Widget booking** (`POST /api/widget/:hotelId/book`):
  - If `billingStatus === 'blocked'` → returns **403** with a guest-safe message.
  - Crypto bookings auto-refresh billing status.
  - In grace period → booking is allowed; response includes `billingWarning`.
- **Pay-at-property confirmation** (`POST /api/bookings/:bookingRef/confirm`):
  - On confirmation, recalculates trial usage and updates billing state.

#### 6.5 Billing API ✅ Delivered
- Added `backend/src/routes/billing.js` and registered in `server.js`:
  - `GET /api/billing/status`
  - `POST /api/billing/refresh`
  - `POST /api/billing/payment` (submit tx hash; currently reactivates account without on-chain verification)
  - `GET /api/billing/payment-instructions` (provides Bitsy addresses; placeholders until real addresses added)
  - `POST /api/billing/verify-location`

#### 6.6 Dashboard UX ✅ Delivered
- Added `BillingStatusCard` shown at top of `/dashboard/stats`:
  - Progress bar `$used / $5,000`
  - Status badges: Trial | Grace | Blocked | Active
  - Commission owed calculation for grace state
  - Clear copy about 7-day grace period

#### 6.7 Settings UX (Location Verification + Payment Due UI) ✅ Delivered
- Added Location Verification form to `/dashboard/settings`:
  - Address + city + state + country + postal code
  - Status badge: unverified/pending/verified/rejected
  - Submits to `/api/billing/verify-location` → marks pending
- Added commission payment due panel (shows in grace/blocked):
  - Trial limit / bookings total / commission owed
  - Tx hash submission calls `/api/billing/payment`

#### 6.8 Testing / exit criteria ✅ Met
- Verified full lifecycle works:
  - `trial → grace → blocked → active`
  - Booking API blocks in `blocked` state (403)
  - UI indicators render correctly for trial/grace/blocked/active

---

## 3) Next Actions (Immediate)
1. ✅ Billing enforcement + location verification are now live (Phase 6 complete).
2. ⚠️ Add production-grade email delivery (SES/Resend) for booking + marketplace notifications.
3. ⚠️ Replace placeholder Bitsy receiving addresses with real production wallets and decide payment verification workflow.
4. ✅ Deploy to AWS using `/app/DEPLOYMENT_AWS.md` (Emergent native deployment is incompatible with Node + Web3).

---

## 4) Success Criteria
**Achieved**
- ✅ Hotels can toggle pay-at-property; crypto remains default.
- ✅ Pay-at-property bookings show exact 48h confirmation deadline; auto-cancel works.
- ✅ Guests can lookup bookings via email+phone, cancel eligible bookings, and list crypto bookings.
- ✅ Marketplace supports crypto-only listings with on-chain proof and reliable transfer.
- ✅ Demo video is self-hosted and working.
- ✅ Trial usage accurately tracked ($5k) across crypto + confirmed pay-at-property.
- ✅ Grace period begins at $5k and lasts 7 days.
- ✅ Bookings blocked only after grace period ends (not immediately).
- ✅ Dashboard shows clear trial/grace/blocked/active state + progress indicator.
- ✅ Location verification UI and status tracking implemented to reduce spam hotel listings.

**Remaining / Future**
- ⚠️ Automated commission reconciliation (on-chain verification of payment tx hash; admin review workflow).
- ⚠️ Policy decisions: whether to restrict widget activation or marketplace visibility until location is verified.
- ⚠️ Full AWS production deployment + environment hardening.
